## Project Description
Our project focuses on the effect of pollutants on people in different neighbourhoods of Amsterdam. Elevated concentrations of air pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) have adverse effects on human health. For our current study we chose to study the trend of 3 pollutants that includes NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 in Amsterdam.

We initially identified the following 4 neighbourhoods where we had data of the 3 pollutants from 2012 through 2019.
1. Einsteinweg - A10 West
2. Van Diemenstraat
3. Vondelpark
4. Stadhouderskade

After an initail data analysis we chose Einsteinweg and Vondelpark to study deeper and understand the effects of pollutants and the associated trends.


## Questions & Hypotheses
Q1. Is there a decrease in pollution from 2012 through 2019 because of new policies?
Q2. 

Hypothesis: Trees improve air-quality of a neighbourhood.
