## Project Description
Our project focuses on the effect of trees on air-quality. We would like to study the density of the tress and its relationship with air-quality. We would like to measure the air-quality in 8 neighbourhoods of Amsterdam. They include:
1. Centrum
2. De Pijp
3. Overtoom
4. De Baarsjes
5. Bos en Lommer
6. Haarlemmerweg
7. Westerpark
8. Van Diementstraat


## Questions & Hypotheses
Q1. Is the number of trees in different Amsterdam areas negatively related to the air pollution of the area? 
Q2. Is the number of inhabitants in different Amsterdam areas positively related to the air pollution of the area?

Hypothesis: Trees improve air-quality of a neighbourhood. 

## Dataset
What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

Our dataset includes the following:
1. CSV files of around 280,000 trees in Amsterdam Neighbourhood - https://maps.amsterdam.nl/open_geodata/
2. CSV file of Amsterdam Neighbourhoods.
3. Air-quality data of Amsterdam Neighbourhoods - https://www.luchtmeetnet.nl/download


## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include relevant links (that point to google drive or data sources) to your repository, slides, data, database, ERD, and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
